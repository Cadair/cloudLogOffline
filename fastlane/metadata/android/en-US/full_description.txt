CloudLogOffline is an app interface for Cloudlog the cloud logbook for HAM radio OMs and YLs by 2M0SQL.

The main purpose of CloudLogOffline is the portable operating mode, where no Wifi or 3G/LTE is availabe, e.g. SOTA, IOTA or COTA. The logs can be stored in the app and when back to a internet connection, the log can be uploaded to a selfhosted Cloudlog instance.

Currently CloudLogOffline supports following features:

- Upload to Cloudlog via API
- Query QRZ.com (if 3G/LTE is available)
- Connect to Flrig by W1HKJ which e.g. runs on a Raspberry Pi which is connected to the radio and opens a Wifi to interact with CloudLogOffline
- Set a CQ QRG if Flrig is not available
- Live and post QSOs
